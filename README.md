# My-Portfolio-Website

This is My Portfolio Website , I developed it using Python language.
For developling it I used Flask Framework.

# Technology used -
1) Python 
2) FLASK Framework
3) HTML - defined Content & Text
4) CSS - Styling of Website
5) JS - Actions

# Key-Points =>
1) Server.py is the Python main file, use this file to run FLASK as FLASK_APP=Server.py
2) Keep all .html files in "Templates" folder
3) Keep all .css, .js & image files in "Static" folder
4) Create ENV folder by below command
   - cd project-folder
   - python -m venv project-folder-name

# Steps to Run =>
1) execute ".\Scripts\activate" file	=> To activate your programming environment
2) execute below commands from Project Terminal =>
    set FLASK_ENV=development  => for Development environment
    set FLASK_APP=Server.py
    flask run

# About FLASK Framework =>
Flask is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features that make creating web applications in Python easier. It gives developers flexibility and is a more accessible framework for new developers since you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file. Flask is also extensible and doesnâ€™t force a particular directory structure.

By using below pip command we can install Flask 
	pip install flask
